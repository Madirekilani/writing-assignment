If you copy someone else's work, you won't be able to understand the work. Which means you won't gain the skills needed to succeed. Copying is a violation of ethical standards and constitutes copyright infringement, often leading to legal consequences. When you copy, you limit yourself from being creative and developing your ideas.
Fully understanding the work is important because it not only leads to high-quality results but also enables individuals to handle similar tasks more effectively in the future. This understanding builds expertise and improves efficiency over time. Moreover, being able to identify potential issues or challenges during a task enhances problem-solving abilities and boosts confidence. Understanding the work thoroughly indeed lays the foundation for consistent and high-quality performance.
