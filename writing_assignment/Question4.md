I don't have much experience in Data science, but I learned a few things during my research project on how to collect data, clean, analyze, and derive solutions from a data set. I Learned how to tackle complex and challenging problems using analytical techniques and statistical models. I started a course on introduction to Python for beginners on Edx, in which I learned a few things about Python.
