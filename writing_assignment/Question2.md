The reason why I chose this career is that during my final year, I enjoyed my research project exploring my data, uncovering patterns, and finding valuable solutions that helped me take the guesswork out of decision-making. During my academic as an Agricultural Economist, I analyzed a lot of policies, the markets, and the economy of agriculture which is where my passion for data science came from. I have done statistics where we could use analytical techniques and statistical models to find solutions. I am someone who loves learning in general, which has been one of the most exciting elements of this field. I enjoy the process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and also deriving solutions from data sets. The reasons why I applied for this course, are because I have a passion for data and I thrive in challenging situations. I believe my passion for working with data, being a hard worker, and being someone who loves learning, who is disciplined, enjoys tackling complex and challenging problems, and who is career-driven will succeed as a coder. I have developed a personal interest related to data analysis, statistics, and programming through academic pursuits and self-study, and I want to turn this passion into a career in data science.
