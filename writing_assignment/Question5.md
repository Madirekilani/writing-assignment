I believe my passion for working with data, being a hard worker, someone who loves learning, is disciplined, enjoys tackling complex and challenging problems and career-driven individual will help me succeed as a coder. I have developed a personal interest related to data analysis, statistics, and programming through academic pursuits and self-study, and I want to turn this passion into a career in data science. I also believe that my knowledge of statistical models and analytical techniques makes me an ideal candidate for being a coder. I don't have much experience in coding but I'm enjoying this new journey with its challenges
